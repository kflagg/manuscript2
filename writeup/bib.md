# @banerjeegelfandfinley \*

- Simplify high-dimensional spatial and spatiotemporal predictions by projecting the spatial process into a lower-dimensional subset observed at "knots"
- Smaller covariance matrix to invert
- MCMC requires "reasonably informative priors"
- Useful with tens of thousands of prediction points, needs hundreds of knots
- "[F]aster alternatives that avoid MCMC sampling can be employed" (cites the INLA paper)


# @andrieudoucetholenstein \*

- PMCMC combines SMC and MCMC to handle high-dimensional models
- SMC used to generate proposals
- Focus on state space models
- Particle degeneracy less of a problem than with pure SMC
- Efficient exploration wthout a lot of MCMC tuning but slower than INLA
