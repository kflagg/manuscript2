# Paper by strong writers

- Diggle, Peter, and Søren Lophaven. 2006. "Bayesian Geostatistical Design." *Scandinavian Journal of Statistics* 33 (1): 53–64.

## Key story points

- Design
    - Main character?
    - Wants to be optimized for estimation and prediction
    - There are actually several designs mentioned which could be seen as competitors
- Established knowledge
    - Lattice designs best for prediction (when parameters known)
    - SRS best for estimation
- Spatially-averaged prediction variance
    - New criterion, another character
- Criterion gives design regular pattern with some close pairs
    - Regularity good for prediction
    - Close pairs provide a variety of interpoint distances for estimation

## Comments

- Clear introduction of characters
- Illustrations are concise and follow natural flow through conflict to resolution
- Discussion adds context for conclusions (comments on characteristics of designs and influence of prior)


# Paper by ordinary specialist

- Heller, Martin, Jan Hannig, and Malcolm R Leadbetter. 2015. "Optimal Sample Planning for System State Analysis with Partial Data Collection." *Stat* 4 (1): 69–80.

## Key story points

- Goal stated in first sentence before characters introduced
    - Assess if a building contains dangerous levels of a contaminant
    - No hints given on how this will happen
- Predictors introduced as first characters?
    - Happens before any description of models
- Posterior introduced as a character stated to have no role
- Response will not be used
    - Binary classifications observed
    - Stated to be generic instead of pertaining to any model
- Intro ends without introducting any active characters or conflicts
- First characters: system made of generic components which have values observed
- Objective is to make a decision about a state of the system, which is a function of the components
- Loss function another character
    - Response _should_ be a character but isn't because the authors want to be general so response only appears in the decision function, of which the loss is a fucntion
- Loss function guides to an optimal design (set of components)
- Mini narrative describing the algorithms
- State and decision are main characters
- Conflict: state and decision need to agree to avoid error
    - Error has real-world cost, described by loss functions
- Mini narrative about computing the risk efficiently
- Mini narrative about finding the optimal set of components
    - Replace components one at a time, progresses the main story but feels disconnected
- Simulation mini narratives presented after all the general theory
- The proposed algorithm does better than two simpler algorithms on their simple simulations and one loss function

## Comments

- Lots of confusing wording
- Introduction gets more general as it progresses and introduces characters and information that do not progress the narrative
- Lots exposition spent making the problem sound hard without saying what will actually happen
    - Point out many things that are stated to be irrelevant
- Long intro should be moved to a background section
- Technical comments and mini narratives get in the way of the main narrative once it gets going
- Narrative finally appears in section 4
- Simulation narratives would be more interesting if they had more exposition of their own instead of expecting the reader to insert them into the modular generic version
- Conclusion discusses role of prior but makes modeling sound complicated
- The layout is logical but sections are too modularized to be coherent


# Review paper

- Christman, Mary C. 2000. "A Review of Quadrat-Based Sampling of Rare, Geographically Clustered Populations." *Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics*, 168–201.

## Key story points

- Which sampling designs are appropriate in natural resource studies where the trait of interest is rare and clustered?
- Defines evaluation criteria up front
- Starts general and gets specific so characters (designs) represent understandable categories
    - Design-optimal quadrat sampling
- Character: Horvitz-Thompson estimator enters story because it is common estimator that is good in many situations
- Characters: Elements within quadrats that will be counted
- Characters: Population of quadrat counts
- Characters: Sampling designs
    - Each gets as much of a modular mini narrative as needed to explain it
- Simulaion study where some specific populations are defined
- Designs compete as if simulation is a contest
    - Results section points out which designs did best for which populations
- Stratified design is a clear winner in most simulations
- Systematic sampling is ok stratification is not possible

## Comments

- Notation and numerical results relagated to appendix so they don't get in the way
- Technical explanations of the designs are unavoidable but can easily be skipped so they don't interfere with the story
- Framing sections and results form a story that is easy to follow
- Discussion points out other possible study objectives that may conflict with the goals of the simulation
